# Design of Inverting Amplifier

## AIM:

To design and construct a inverting amplifier using op-amp(IC-741). 

## APPARATUS REQUIRED:

## THEORY: 

INVERTING AMPLIFIER: 
This is the most widely used op-amp. Here, the output voltage Vo is feedback to the 
inverting input terminal through the Rf – R1 network. The negative sign in gain indicates the 
phase shift of 180ο. 

The circuit closed-loop voltage gain is Avcl= -RF / R1

 ## DESIGN: 
~~~
Inverting amplifier: 
A = -Rf/R1       
Take   A = 10 
Rf =10 R1 
Choose  R1 = 1kΩ, Rf=10kΩ  
~~~

## PROCEDURE:
 
1. Select R1 as a constant value and choose a value of Rf.  
2. Connect the circuit as per as the circuit diagram.  
3. Apply the constant amplitude input voltage to the circuit.  
4. Measure the output voltage amplitude for different value of V1 from DSO.  
5. Calculate the practical Voltage for different value of V1& compare it with theoretical output.  
6. Practical gain & theoretical voltage should be approximately equal.  
7. Plot the graph of the input wave versus output wave for any one practical case.
